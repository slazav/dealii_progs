My deal.II programs:
- test_eig  - Simple example of an eigenvalue program.
- polar_hqv - A d-soliton between a pair of half-quantum vortices
              in 3He polar phase and spinwave in it.

How to build:
- modify DEAL_II_DIR in CMakeLists.txt (folder with deal.II installation)
- run "cmake ."
- run "make"
